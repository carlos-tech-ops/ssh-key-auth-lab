## Objective

To configure secure, passwordless SSH access from a MacBook (client) to a Fedora Linux machine (server) using SSH key-based authentication. The goal was not just to connect â€” but to deeply understand how SSH works, troubleshoot real system-level errors, and document everything like a cloud security engineer in training.

## Test Environment

| Role        | Hostname     | IP Address     | OS        | Purpose                     |
|-------------|--------------|----------------|-----------|-----------------------------|
| Client      | macOS-M1     | 192.168.1.198  | macOS 14  | Generates SSH key & initiates connection |
| Server      | fedora-ops   | 192.168.1.8    | Fedora 41 | Accepts SSH connection, hardened |

> Note: Both devices were on the same local network. Timezone synchronization and SELinux config were handled manually.
